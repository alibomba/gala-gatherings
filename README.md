# Gala Gatherings
Gala Gatherings is an imaginary business carrying out special events like weddings, birthday parties, business parties etc. It's a website of that business along with its own Content Management System (CMS). On the website there are listed the services of the company, its past events visible as portfolio, event locations to choose from and all of the above editable from the admin panel. There is also a job applying functionality via the special form. The client can also send a question or an order through the contact form, that is also located on the website. The graphic design is made by me in Figma, frontend is built in ReactJS, and the backend is in NodeJS with Express framework and PostgreSQL database. ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used in the app is Prisma. There is also a server-side caching feature implemented with Redis.
